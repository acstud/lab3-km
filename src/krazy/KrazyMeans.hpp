/**
 * @brief KrazyMeans context used for Feature Vector clustering.
 *
 * KrazyMeans is a modified version of the K-means algorithm that does not work with a maximum number of iterations.
 * Instead, to reach faster convergence, a threshold number of iterations can be supplied. When the threshold iteration
 * is reached, the distances of points that want to swap to another cluster during the updating of the labels are
 * multiplied by some factor. This factor grows linearly with the number of iterations over the threshold. Hereby, the
 * likeliness of swapping a point to another cluster is decreased, allowing the clustering algorithm to converge more
 * quickly.
 *
 * This algorithm is called KrazyMeans, because it is almost identical to K-Means, but contains the aforementioned
 * rather crazy modification, to make the assignment relatively unique and not easily copied from some other source
 * for the Advanced Computing Systems course at TU Delft.
